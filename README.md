Udacity FE Web Development Nanodegree: Project 3
================================================
Arcade Game
-----------

For this project, I've used certain image and JavaScript files provided by Udacity to create a basic arcade game. The bulk of the work was done in the app.js file.

Playing is simple: Use the up, down, left and right arrow keys to guide your character (the princess) across the road and into the river without colliding with bug monsters (a.k.a. enemies).

### HOW TO RUN: ###
Simply download the ZIP file from Github, extract the files, and open "index.html" in your favorite browser.

### ENHANCEMENTS: ###
------------
Over and above Udacity's basic requirements, I've added the following functionality:
1. An "Add Enemy" button that allows the player to add bug monsters, effectively increasing the difficulty of the game
2. An "Increase Speed" button that increases the speed of all bug monsters, effectively increasing the difficulty of the game

The two enhancements can result in some very challenging scenarios for our princess:
